# Joke-Teller-WebApp
Joke-Teller-WebApp is a responsive web application that tells jokes out loud when asked. In order to accomplish that, I have used a joke API to get random jokes which are passed to a text-to-speech API in order to tell us that joke.<br><br>
The site can be seen live here: https://gaitaaidanadine.github.io/Joke-Teller-WebApp/
